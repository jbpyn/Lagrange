### Theme for 'Attention Madness", the Personal Blog of Jai Bentley-Payne

This site is built from a fork of the [Lagrange theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange). It has been heavily adapted for my own purposes, under fragmented circumstances. It's unlikely I could retrace my steps if I tried, so bare that in mind if you have any questions.
