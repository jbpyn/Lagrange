Attention Madness is part [micro.blog](http://micro.blog/jbp), part experiment, and personal web log. Put together for the purpose of sharing with the indie web principle of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), it is a hack station for me to learn enough web development skills to be a nuisance

### About the Site

The site is built with Jekyll a hacked up version of the wonderfully minimal 
[Langrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) theme. The clean layout and comparatively simple stack have been a good playground for becoming self-sufficient with a static site.
