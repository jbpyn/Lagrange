Attention Madness is part [micro.blog](http://micro.blog/jbp), part experiment, part personal web log. Put together for the purpose of sharing with the indie web principle of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), it is a hack station for me to learn enough web development skills to be a nuisance, and a place to share things without that gross feeling that I'm being owned. 

### About the Site

The site is built with Jekyll a hacked up version of the wonderfully minimal 
[Langrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) theme. The clean layout and comparatively simple stack have been a good playground for becoming self-sufficient with a static site. I have made quite a few changes, so given my thoroughly amateur approach and status, if you wish to use the theme I would recommend forking the original. Otherwise, fill your boots, this version comes as is, with no guarantees. [^1]
